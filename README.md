# MelaSense
MelaSense is a repository focused on melanoma classification using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow. It includes code for building a multi-class classification model to identify various types of skin cancer, particularly melanoma, using skin lesion images.
## Abstract

Melanoma is one of the deadliest type of skin cancer that exists. There are so many factors which leads to Melanoma, the primary ones include exposure to UV rays, poor immune system, rare genetic conditions, a history of affected family member and others. Melanoma develops in our skin cells called melanocytes. It starts when the healthy cells begin to grow out of control, creating a cancerous tumor. If this is not diagnosed in the early stages the mortality rate reduces to less than 20% where as in early detection the mortality rate is 95%. Melanoma can be cured if diagnosed early, else they spread to other body parts and leads to death.


## Problem Statement
 In the skin biopsy, the dermatologist takes some part of the skin lesion and examines it under the microscope. The current process takes almost a week or more, starting from getting a dermatologist appointment to getting a biopsy report.
 The aims to shorten the current gap to just a couple of days by providing the predictive model.
 The approach uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify nine types of skin cancer from outlier lesions images. This reduction of a gap has the opportunity to impact millions of people positively.
